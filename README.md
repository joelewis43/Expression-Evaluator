# Expression Evaluator

Write a problem to evaluate arithmetic expressions. Input will be test expression strings.

The solution should
- Demonstrate the ability to parse/evaluate arithmetic expressions
- Support **addition** and **multiplication** and be easily extensible to add other operations later
- Be designed and implemented in an OO manner
- Not use the "Shunting Yard" algorithm
- Contain a testing framework to validate the solution is functioning as desired
