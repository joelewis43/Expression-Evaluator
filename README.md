# Expression Evaluator

## Problem Statement
Write a problem to evaluate arithmetic expressions. Input will be test expression strings.

## Considerations
- Demonstrate the ability to parse/evaluate arithmetic expressions
- Support **addition** and **multiplication** and be easily extensible to add other operations later
- Be designed and implemented in an OO manner
- Not use the "Shunting Yard" algorithm
- Contain a testing framework to validate the solution is functioning as desired
- How can the test approach be incorporated into a CI system
- Consider all error situations in validation and testing
- Documentation: comments when things are not obvious

## How to run the application
1. Clone the code to your local machine
